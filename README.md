# WantBrolly 

A machine learning project with different model comparison, data analysis and predicts the downpour through the dataset.

The dataset is a Australia weather dataset with a combination of string and numerical values.

The wantBrolly project classifies whether there will be rain today or not as well as tomorrow, brolly is the other name of umbrella so the project classifies whether there is a need to take umbrella or not.

THE FLOW OF THE PROJECT

Data cleaning - removing null values, removing unnecessary columns and rows

Data visualization - The relationship between the attributes, comparison between attributes are examined using visuals like line plot, scatter plot, etc..

Data preprocessing - The dataset contains numeric as well as string data so preprocessing the data is necessary

Test and Train - split the given dataset into train and test data for prediction using different models

Data models - models like logistic regression , random forest classifier, decisoin tree, linear regression are used

Precipitaion prediction - The precipitatipon level is predicted using linear regression model

import website - The website is imported into the project and rainfall is predicted according to the city entered.
